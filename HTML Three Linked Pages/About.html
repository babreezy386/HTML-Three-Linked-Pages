     We believe in truly placing the power of knowledge, technology, and opportunity in the hands of the youth.
    Through our flagship program, the #1MillionDevs4Africa initiative has scaled to 5 African countries:
     onboarding 5,000+ learners from Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia onto our unique, 
     custom-made learning platform.
