        <P style="font-size: 30px;">
            My kitchen is completely functional. It is the loneliest place in my entire home.
            Though I am not that good in cooking but I take proper care that all the appliances are aligned properly 
            and the kitchen is cleaned up. I never allow anybody to enter my kitchen wearing shoes.
            I ask them to open their shoes before entering the kitchen because I like to keep my kitchen area clean and tidy.

        The kitchen has dark brown cabinets with two double doors.
        These cabinets are filled with dishes, cups and bowls on one side and spices along with a box of assorted celestial seasons tea and two boxes of assorted individual packs of oatmeal on the other. To the right, below the cabinet doors is the sink, there are generally dirty dishes in the sink just begging to be washed. The sink is surrounded by a forlorn stove to the left and a dish rack to the right. The frequently used white refrigerator is located about 10 inches in front of the dish rack and stands next to the microwave rack, which houses a black microwave and a biscuit colored convectional oven. Right in front of the rack is a six chair, black dining room table with gold trimmings.
