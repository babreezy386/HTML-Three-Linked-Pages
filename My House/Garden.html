        A Garden is the best place in the house according to me.<br>
        As it is the only place where a person can get relief from a busy life.
        Moreover having a garden in the house welcomes many health benefits.
        For instance, a garden has many plants that give oxygen.

        <p style="font-size: 30px;">My Garden
        My garden contains different types of plants. 
        For instance, it has different flowers such as roses, sunflowers, Lilies, daisies.
        These flowers are the easiest to grow and flourish the environment with their beautiful smells. 
        Moreover, the colors of these flowers make a garden look beautiful.</p>
